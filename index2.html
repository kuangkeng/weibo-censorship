Since the <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1626744/tigers-and-flies-chinese-communist-partys-anti-corruption">anti-corruption campaign</a> launched by president Xi Jinping in March 2013, senior officials investigated were referred to as “tiger” while middle and lower ranking officials were “flies”. The phrase “rise to the surface” here means that another “tiger” has been implicated in graft investigation.

The phrase, literally means “may the wind fill your sails”, is a common Chinese greeting phrase to wish someone a safe trip or best of luck. It was blocked after a pro-Beijing newspaper published a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/18/xi-jinping-taxi-hoax">news story</a> claiming that the President Xi Jinping gave a note written with the phrase to a cab driver after he took the cab like an ordinary citizen. State news agency Xinhua later reported that the story is fake.

“Kang Shifu” or Master Kong is a popular instant noodle brand in China.

“Wen Shen” means the god of plague in Chinese, a Chinese deity that spreads diseases. The phrase was used to allude to former premier Wen Jiabao as his surname “Wen” shares the same pronunciation as the “Wen” in “Wen Shen” although they are two different characters.
