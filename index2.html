    Creative netizens tried to circumvent the censorship by using alternative words to allude to sensitive issues, but many were detected by the censors. As the Tiananmen Square protest that happened on Jun. 4, 1989 is popularly known as "six four incident", those trying to get around the censors used different number combinations to suggest the incident such as "35" (May 35th), "63+1", "65-1", "89" (year 1989), "viiv" (64 in Roman numerals) and "eight squared" (八的平方), but all failed. Even the English word "June" was blocked.

Weibo users also used phrases like "占占点" and "占点占" that have no meaning but graphically illustrate the scenario of tanks (占) crushing protesters (灬). They were blocked as well.

"Prince Qing of First Rank" (庆亲王), the title of a prince of the Qing Dynasty. It was blocked after the party’s internal disciplinary body published an anti-corruption article about the prince who lived an extravagant lifestyle.

    President Xi Jinping has launched a nationwide crackdown on government corruption when he took over the office in March 2013. Amongst the high-ranking officials who have been brought down include former security chief Zhou Yongkang, former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai and former general Xu Caihou. However, speculations were drawn whether Xi’s anti-corruption campaign was a sign of political reform or a political maneuver to persecute his rivals in the Communist Party.

The name of former premier “Zhu Rongji” (朱榕基) was blocked on Mar. 18, 2015 after a news report claimed that he criticized former vice president Zeng Qinghong in a party meeting. Another general political phrase “Xi Jinping era” (习近平时代) was prohibited in early April 2015 probably due to the ongoing anti-corruption campaign launched by Xi.
